A fork of [weee50's repository](https://github.com/weee50/barelychess2/).   
For the rules, here's the [reddit post explaining Chess 2 rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/qp2gaw/a_day_ago_i_told_you_to_post_suggestions_for/) or the [rule page](https://clikuki.github.io/barelychess2/rules.html).

# My plans with Chess 2
I thought chess 2 sounded kinda fun, so I'll try contributing a bit by fixing some issues and adding some features. I've never made a chess clone before though, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to accomplish.

# Some stuff to do/fix
### Taken from his post
- Vertical castling doesn't function.
- There are probably some quirks related to en passant and check.
- I don't think the Warrior's bonus move works.
- The algebraic notation sometimes freaks out.
- This thing doesn't even have multiplayer! (Or computer play, for that matter. Literally the only thing you can do is move pieces by yourself, or maybe with a friend over the (virtual) board if you even have one that would be willing to play a very bad version of Chess 2.)
### Bugs I found
- <s>On load, none of the pieces show up, instead of only some of the pieces being invisible</s>

# Stuff currently done
- Formatted and styled rules.html
- Board and algebraic notation display is now always side-by-side
