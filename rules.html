      <p>Anarchian Chess 2 is a chess variant created by members of the r/AnarchyChess community, a subreddit which focuses on chess memes. On November 6, 2021, I created a post on the subreddit inviting its members to create piece suggestions, saying that the top 8 upvoted would appear in Chess 2. Every piece in this variant (besides the king and pawns) were suggested by the community.</p>
      
      <a name="pieces"></a><h2>Pieces</h2>
      <p>There are two kinds of pieces in this game: the pawn-like pieces and the non-pawn-like pieces. Non-pawn-like pieces occupy the outermost ranks, and pawn-like pieces occupy the second-outermost ranks. The list of pieces is as follows (I'll add images to these once I can):</p>
      
      <h1>Non-Pawn-Like Pieces</h1>
      
      <p>The <strong>King</strong> and <strong>Queen</strong> (the latter suggested by u/I-D-H-A-N) move as in standard Chess.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Edgedancer</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/MasterStudmane) moves one square in any orthogonal or diagonal direction. It can also immediately move to any edge of the board with a horizontal move&nbsp;as long as nothing is blocking its path. If it is on the edge of the board, it can move along the edge&nbsp;as well.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Literate Knight</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/Ronnoc67) along with being able to move in an L shape like a regular Knight, can also move in any other capital letter, as long as that letter is made up of one path with no branches. When moving a Literate Knight in over-the-board&nbsp;Chess 2, you must physically move it in the shape of a letter. (This rule does not apply to online Chess 2.) The Literate Knight can jump over other pieces while making a move. The list of letters you can move a Literate Knight in and the corresponding number of squares moved as a result of performing each letter is below. A pair (x,y) here means "move x squares in any direction and y squares in any perpendicular direction", so (2,1) would correspond to a normal Knight movement.)</p>
      
      <p>B, D, O: (0,0) (note: This means there is no zugzwang when a Literate Knight is on the board.)<br>
      C, I, U, V: (2,0)<br>
      G: (1,1)<br>
      M, W: (3,0)<br>
      J, L, N, S, Z: (2,1)<br>
      P, R: (1,0)</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Archer</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/kabigon2k) moves like a Queen, but is limited to 4 spaces of movement. However, it can only capture by shooting at enemy pieces straight forward from up to 4 squares away. (It cannot capture any direction other than forward.) This does not move the Archer in the process. Neither the Archer nor its shots can pass through other pieces.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Squire</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/PM180) is like the Knight, but it is lesser, so it only moves in the shape of a lowercase L. This means it can move either two squares in any direction (if the L is printed) or one square in any direction (if the L is cursive and loops through, note that the "loop" of the cursive L does not restrict the piece's movement.)</p>
      
      <p>The<strong>&nbsp;Priest</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/ExistingBathroom9742) moves like a Bishop in regular Chess, but can only capture pawns. It cannot be captured if it is protected by another friendly piece. If a Priest takes 4 pawns, it is removed from the game.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Peasant</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/jeffreyb6x3) moves one square horizontally or diagonally, but not straight vertically. It can capture its own side's king to establish a collectivist government. When this happens, the following rules change:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The player can now only lose when all of their pieces are captured, with the exception of Blockers and Priests.</li>
        <li>The player's Queen (including all pawns promoted to Queens) can now only move like Kings.</li>
        <li>Pawns can now be promoted to Kings. When this is done, the monarchy is restored and the rules of the collectivist government are undone.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>&nbsp;Promoting a Pawn to a King is the only way to end the collectivist government, as not even capturing one or both Peasants can accomplish this.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Blocker</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by&nbsp;xX_Xineohp69_Xx) moves like a King, but cannot capture, and cannot be captured. They block pieces from moving through their square just as a regular piece would.</p>
      
      <h1>Pawn-Like Pieces</h1>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Pawn</strong>&nbsp;moves like in regular Chess, but can move two squares by default and four squares on its first move. En passant can still be done after any move of two or more steps at any square the target piece&nbsp;passed through. It must promote upon reaching the last rank.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Spy</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/gemohandy)&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Super Pawn</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/Azazel767)&nbsp;have cosmetic differences from regular pawns: the Spy "allows you to see your opponent's pieces and disguises as a regular Pawn upon moving"&nbsp;and the Super Pawn "has better self-esteem than a regular Pawn", but because these things do not have any effect on gameplay (you can still see your opponent's pieces even without any Spies), they can simply be substituted with regular Pawns.</p>
      
      <p>The <strong>Warlock</strong> (suggested by u/IDaidokoroI) moves like a Chess 2 pawn. However, if it has the ability to capture en passant, it is required to do so on its turn. (This does not apply if the en passant move is illegal due to it creating a check on the player's own king.) When it captures in any way (including en passant), the player is granted the ability to move again on their turn. However, this extra move must be with a pawn-like piece besides a Warlock. You can choose to not take the extra move if you want.</p>
      
      <p>The <strong>Lance</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/kabigon2k) moves like the Lance in Shogi, moving or capturing any number of squares forward.&nbsp;It must promote upon reaching the last rank. This piece cannot take en passant.</p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Jumper</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/kabigon2k) moves one square diagonally forwards. It captures by jumping over a piece, thus making a move two squares diagonally and removing the piece one square diagonally in the same direction. If the position of the board allows, the Jumper can make more than one capturing move in a single turn. It cannot make a jump and a regular move in the same turn. Upon reaching a final rank, the Jumper must promote to a <strong>Leaper</strong>, which moves like the Jumper, but can also move diagonally backwards. <em>(No, this totally isn't just a Checkers piece, capturing with it isn't even forced, what do you mean?)</em></p>
      
      <p>The&nbsp;<strong>Croissant</strong>&nbsp;(suggested by u/lordunderscore) moves like a Chess 2 Pawn, but can only capture "en croissant". An en croissant capture is like an en passant capture, but it can be done with every compatible piece, not just pawn-like pieces.&nbsp;This happens if a Croissant moves one square diagonally forward to a square that the opponent's last moved piece passed through but did not land on last turn. (A square that a piece "passes through" is a square that, if there was an enemy&nbsp;piece on it, would have caused the piece to be unable to move to its intended destination. This means jumping pieces are immune to en croissant.)</p>
      
      <a name="rules"></a><h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>This game follows the rules of Chess except for the following differences:</p>
      
      <p>Piece movement is different (as explained above).</p>
      
      <p>All pawn-like pieces that can capture en passant can capture any other pawn-like piece en passant. The croissant is an exception to this rule, as it can capture any piece en croissant.</p>
      
      <p>All pawn-like pieces (besides the Jumper) can promote to any non-pawn-like piece (besides the King when there is no collectivist government).</p>
      
      <p>Castling can still be done with the King and Edgedancers, but the King must move four squares towards an Edgedancer (and the Edgedancer will move to the square just behind the King.) All of the normal restrictions for castling still apply.</p>
      
      <p>If en passant (counting en croissant)&nbsp;is taken 12 times in a single game (counting both sides), Garry Chess (the memetic "creator" of Chess) cameos and wins the game. In online chess, this can be considered a draw.</p>
      
      <p>The 50-move rule has been replaced with a 100-move rule, which works exactly the same, but requires 100 turns without moving a pawn-like piece or capturing a piece instead.</p>
