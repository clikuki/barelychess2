			<p>
				Anarchian Chess 2 is a chess variant created by members of the
				r/AnarchyChess community, a subreddit which focuses on chess
				memes. On November 6, 2021, I created a post on the subreddit
				inviting its members to create piece suggestions, saying that
				the top 8 upvoted would appear in Chess 2. Every piece in this
				variant (besides the king and pawns) were suggested by the
				community.
			</p>

			<h2 id="pieces">Pieces</h2>
			<p>
				There are two kinds of pieces in this game: the pawn-like pieces
				and the non-pawn-like pieces. Non-pawn-like pieces occupy the
				outermost ranks (A and P rank), and pawn-like pieces occupy the
				second-outermost ranks (B and O rank). The list of pieces is as
				follows:

						nothing is blocking its path. If it is on the edge of

							The <b>Literate Knight</b>
							along with being able to move in an L shape like a
							regular Knight, can also move in any other capital
							letter, as long as that letter is made up of one
							path with no branches. When moving a Literate Knight
							in over-the-board Chess 2, you must physically move
							it in the shape of a letter. (This rule does not
							apply to online Chess 2.) The Literate Knight can
							jump over other pieces while making a move. The list
							of letters you can move a Literate Knight in and the
							corresponding number of squares moved as a result of
							performing each letter is below. A pair (x,y) here
							means "move x squares in any direction and y squares
							in any perpendicular direction", so (2,1) would

					<p class="pieceDescription">
						The <b>Archer</b> moves like a Queen, but is limited to

						process. Neither the Archer nor its shots can pass
						through other pieces.

						The <b>Squire</b> is like the Knight, but it is lesser,

							The <b>Peasant</b> moves one square horizontally or

								The player's Queen (including all pawns promoted
								to Queens) can now only move like Kings.

							<li>
								Pawns can now be promoted to Kings. When this is
								done, the monarchy is restored and the rules of
								the collectivist government are undone.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Promoting a Pawn to a King is the only way to end
							the collectivist government, as not even capturing
							one or both Peasants can accomplish this.

					<p class="pieceDescription">
						The <b>Spy</b> has cosmetic differences from regular

						because this does not have any effect on gameplay (you
						can still see your opponent's pieces even without any
						Spies), they can simply be substituted with regular

					<h4 class="pieceName">Warlock</h4>
					<span class="pieceSuggester"
						>suggested by u/IDaidokoroI</span
					>
					<p class="pieceDescription">
						The <b>Warlock</b>
						moves like a Chess 2 pawn. However, if it has the
						ability to capture en passant, it is required to do so
						on its turn. (This does not apply if the en passant move
						is illegal due to it creating a check on the player's
						own king.) When it captures in any way (including en
						passant), the player is granted the ability to move
						again on their turn. However, this extra move must be
						with a pawn-like piece besides a Warlock. You can choose
						to not take the extra move if you want.

					<h4 class="pieceName">Jumper</h4>

					<p class="pieceDescription">
						The <b>Jumper</b> moves one square diagonally forwards.
						It captures by jumping over a piece, thus making a move
						two squares diagonally and removing the piece one square
						diagonally in the same direction. If the position of the
						board allows, the Jumper can make more than one
						capturing move in a single turn. It cannot make a jump
						and a regular move in the same turn. Upon reaching the
						final rank, the Jumper must promote to a <b>Leaper</b>.

					<h4 class="pieceName">Croissant</h4>
					<span class="pieceSuggester"
						>suggested by u/lordunderscore</span
					>
					<p class="pieceDescription">
						The <b>Croissant</b> moves like a Chess 2 Pawn, but can
						only capture "en croissant". An en croissant capture is
						like an en passant capture, but it can be done with
						every compatible piece, not just pawn-like pieces. This
						happens if a Croissant moves one square diagonally
						forward to a square that the opponent's last moved piece
						passed through but did not land on last turn. (A square
						that a piece "passes through" is a square that, if there
						was an enemy piece on it, would have caused the piece to
						be unable to move to its intended destination. This
						means jumping pieces are immune to en croissant.)

			</section>
			<section>
				<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
				<p>
					This game follows the rules of standard Chess except for the
					following differences:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Piece movement is different (as explained above).</li>
					<li>
						All pawn-like pieces that can capture en passant can
						capture any other pawn-like piece en passant. The
						croissant is an exception to this rule, as it can
						capture any piece en croissant.
					</li>
					<li>
						All pawn-like pieces (besides the Jumper) can promote to
						any non-pawn-like piece (besides the King when there is
						no collectivist government).
					</li>
					<li>
						Castling can still be done with the King and
						Edgedancers, but the King must move four squares towards
						an Edgedancer (and the Edgedancer will move to the
						square just behind the King.) All of the normal
						restrictions for castling still apply.
					</li>
					<li>
						If en passant (counting en croissant) is taken 12 times
						in a single game (counting both sides), Garry Chess (the
						memetic "creator" of Chess) cameos and wins the game. In
						online chess, this can be considered a draw.
					</li>
					<li>
						The 50-move rule has been replaced with a 100-move rule,
						which works exactly the same, but requires 100 turns
						without moving a pawn-like piece or capturing a piece
						instead.
